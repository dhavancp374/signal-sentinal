# Signal Sentinel – GPS Spoofing & Jamming Detection System

Signal Sentinel is a machine learning–based system designed to detect **GPS spoofing and signal interference** in real time. The project analyzes GPS data streams and identifies anomalies using trained models, providing alerts and visualizations through a web-based dashboard.

This system is applicable in domains such as **autonomous navigation, aviation, defense systems, and critical infrastructure monitoring**, where GPS integrity is essential.
